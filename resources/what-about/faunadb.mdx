title: "What about FaunaDB?"
---

It's always a risk when considering new tech for your applications. With FaunaDB
you'll have to learn how to do things that are only specific to FaunaDB, such as
Fauna Query Language (FQL). If the requirements for your application change and
you need to move to another provider, you'll have to rewrite all of your Fauna
specific code. Another aspect is that FaunaDB comes with GraphQL. GraphQL should
NOT be used between your server and your database. GraphQL is designed to work
between your client and your services.
