title: "What about MongoDB Atlas?"
---

MongoDB Atlas now has an option to globally distribute your data. This data
replication is only eventually consistent, which means that there is no data
consistency guarantee when reading from different regions.

I also don't recommend going with NoSQL as your main data source. The structure
that is provided by relational databases with the type safety from tools such as
Prisma, is the best way to manage the data for your applications. For me, the
argument between NoSQL and relational databases is similar to the argument
between JavaScript and TypeScript. One allows you to do whatever you want (NoSQL
/ JavaScript), the other provides structure and safety for you to build large
applications (relational database / TypeScript).
