title: "What about Google Cloud Spanner?"
---

I really like the idea of Cloud Spanner. It's a multi-region SQL database with
strong consistency. Recently Google released a PostgreSQL adapter for Spanner.
This, however, comes with a lot of limitations and does not allow you to easily
port your existing application to use Spanner.
