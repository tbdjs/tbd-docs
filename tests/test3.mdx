Next, let's retrieve 1K records from the database. Nubo is able to respond in
less time with 1K records, compared to retrieving a single record from the other
platforms. In fact, I was able to retrieve 8K records with Nubo faster than
retrieving one record from Vercel with CockroachDB and Cloudflare Workers with
D1.
