## TLDR

I built a platform for running your applications and data on the edge with
TypeScript (Bun and Deno) and SQL with strong consistency (MySQL compatible that
works with Prisma!)

## What is the edge?

In the world of building web applications, there are many different types of
architectures to choose from. You have choices such as servers, containers,
JAMStack, fully static websites, serverless, and lately, the edge.

Before we dive in, let's discuss what "the edge" actually is. Put simply, it's
having your code distributed on many servers around the world, then routing a
user's request to the closest deployment. This means that your users experience
low latency access to your apps no matter where they are located in the world.

I've read many articles that talk about the edge being the future of cloud
computing. Platforms such as Cloudflare, Vercel, and Deno have made great
strides towards this becoming a reality. Cloudflare has Workers, Vercel edge
middleware and edge functions, and Deno allowing you to run Deno and WebAssembly
at the edge. Promises of low latency, high scalability, and zero cold starts,
are things that many of us could benefit from for our web applications and these
companies offer great solutions on the way to getting us there.

At first glance it can seem like the edge is going to make your applications run
faster because code is being executed close to your users, however, a very
important aspect is often omitted when discussing the edge, and that is the
data.

Why does data need to be at the edge? Most applications these days will have
some aspect of data storage to deal with. In the case of edge apps, even if your
code is globally distributed and executed at the edge, having your database in a
single region can actually make overall response times slower compared to having
everything (code and data) in a single region, because round trips between your
app and your database can add significant latency.

## Nubo

This why I've been working on my own edge platform - Nubo. It allows you to run
TypeScript apps on the edge and also access your globally distributed data at
the edge.

## Performance

There are many options for globally distributing your code and data, however,
careful consideration needs to be taken when deciding on which
platforms/services to choose for your applications.

I created a test application and deployed it using various combinations of
platforms and services to see how they compare to Nubo.
